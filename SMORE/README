This is the readme to the SMORE pipeline, a Synteny Modulator Of Repetitive Elements.
usage: ./smore <subcommand> [options]

The smore subcommands are:

    prep    This program will sort genetic elements in between genomic anchors
            based on MultiZ alignments. The genetic elements are
            taken from a list given as input or retrieved based on a covariance
	    model as input for infernal.

    toast   This program will take the prep-output and calculate the numbers
            for evolutionary events at the given phylogenetic tree.
            For a more detailed output, use --verbose or any combination
            of --clus, --graph, --aln. Please note that the verbose version
	    might take significantly longer.



Subcommands and their options:

    #general options:
        --help|-h       print help page
	--version|-v    print version information
	--citation	print citation information
	--contact       print contact information
        --helpout       print explanation for structure and visualization of
	                output files

    #options needed in all subcommands
        --tool|-t       path to where the smore tool is located. In this way,
	                no installation is needed.
	--out|-o        folder where to write the output files. If the folder
	                does not exist, it will be created
	--python        path to python
	--perl          path to perl

    #options for prep
        ##General options
        --ref|-r        name of the reference species as given in MultiZ files
	--maf|-m        folder containing all MultiZ alignments. Files can be
	                compressed.
	--filter        optional: remove a percentage of the lowest scoring
	                blocks base on the MAF scores; number between 0 and 100
        ##CM mode
        --cm|-c         covariance model file, input for infernal
	--genomes|-g    folder with genomes of the species used as an input to
	                infernal to scan the genomes for genetic elements
			specified by the CM. Filenames should match species
			names in MultiZ files.

	--incT          optional parameter for infernal, bitscore threshold
	--infernal      path to infernal
        --pseudo        optional parameter, bitscore threshold that defines
	                pseudogenes

	--join		the way of how original clusters should be joined,
			either none, strict or relaxed; default: relaxed
        --nomiss        do not check for missing anchors. in case of large
                        clusters, using --nomiss will speed up the runtime
        --verbose       print all intermediary files, thus clusters, graphs
                        and duplication alignments
        --clus          print only intermediary cluster files

#General Output:
    data_iTOL:   folder giving files that can be uploaded to itol.embl.de
                 The file called F0tree.txt is uploaded at
                 http://itol.embl.de/upload.cgi.
                 The remaining files can be added using drag and drop
                 into the browser window. This will result in a
                 interactive visualization of the resulting tree.
		 A legend is added automatically. All nodes in the tree will
                 have unique names, thus some nodes might have names such as
                 'innerNode0' because it was added automatically.

    OutTree.txt: the resulting tree in newick format with numbers at the
                 nodes given in brackets. This format can be used to
                 visualize the tree with newick compatible programs.

geneticEvents.txt: File listing all genetic events counted during the 
                   analysis. The numbers are sorted by event and node of
                   the tree. The file includes a event called 'Other'. This
                   will give the difference of genetic elements between the
                   total amount and the elements used in the analysis.
                   For a successful run of the pipeline, the numbers should
                   be 0.

allClusters_original.txt 
and allClusters_joined.txt: These two files contain lists of clusters
                            showing which elements are contained together
                            in one cluster before and after joining.

*_errors: for each part of the smore pipeline, there is a file giving errors
          that happened during the run. If no errors occured, the file is
          empty.

list_cographs.txt  and
list_noncographs.txt: these files contain statistics about graphs that were
                      cographs from the beginning or had to be edited in
                      order to become a cograph. The tables list number of
                      nodes, number of edges and density of the graphs.

remoldings.txt and
inremoldings.txt: These files contain genetic elements that (a) have
                  highly similar sequences but different types or (b)
                  have the same types but clearly distinct sequences.
						

allTypes.txt and
allPseudoTypes.txt: These two files list the different types of genetic
                    elements for all species and functional or pseudogenized
                    genes. This can be used to analyse the distribution of
                    different types of genetic elements.

Additional files:
- for each species, there are files listing their genetic elements as
they were used as intermediate files.
- there are files for each of the evolutionary events where counts are
listed.
- for singletons, there is also a listing about types and pseudogenes
- for elements which could not be sorted in between genomic anchors (nones)
there is listings about types and pseudogenes.



Verbose output: the verbose version of toast will output three additional
files (if --verbose) or any combination of them (if --clus, --graph, --aln)
for each cluster, named with left and right anchor numbers to match all three
files. They will be in three different folders: cluster, graph and
duplication_alignment. The files contain the specific structures of the
cluster in each step of the analysis and can be used to gain a deeper
insight into the data.
