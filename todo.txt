ToDo file for our pipeline project:

#All
- name!
- look for ensembl msa's instead of multiz. they can be converted into each other, and ensembl msa seem to have better quality (see m. smith, australia)
- think about how to handle introns
- add parameter as a maximal or minimal threshold for cluster sizes (genomic distance between anchors)


#Anne
- newick tree to ePoPE format parser
- ePoPE format to newick
- sbRNAs cm
- postscript script to draw trees
- postscript script to draw graphs


#Cameron
- include reading of zipped data (do not unzipped files as we get memory issues)
- delete bed files, temporary files (everything we don't need anymore)
- optimize reading of multiz alns (ask fabian externbrink)
- some elements are not sorted into anchors (sbRNAs, distant related species)
- more detailed explanation for gene list input (README_cameron)
- gene lists: be able to include unique IDs for elements such that they can be found later in the graphs


#Sarah
- getNumbers doesn't work
- include counting of singletons/NoneCluster/edgeGraphs/noedgeGraphs in pipeline
- change counting of total number of elements: it is minus 3 as the first 3 lines in the bed files do not stand for elements!!! 
- if user provides the element list, do not count the lines in the bed files!!!
- still mistakes in summary (no NoneCluster folder anymore?)
- give input parameters for alignment (possible for altNW?)
- do not print camerons output (too much)
- for genetic events: always sort the species list alphabetically, such that the entries can be summarized easily! write the summary, ePoPE
- check all 'list' files such that only the real names of the clusters are printed, not all the paths.
- error in altNW, if aligning "AA" and "B", it outputs one mismatch and one duplication, or the strings donot have the same length, in case - is inserted
- option to switch off camerons part because the data already exists (thus output folder has to exist with the genes folder in it) --> parameter to give path to camerons output to be able to run it again
- accept a phylogenetic tree in newick format as input to add the genetic events directly to the tree (one tree for each event?)
- only cographs used for count of genetic events? what about noncographs? if not included in genetic events, count them differently!!!
- what happens to elements in edge graphs that themselves do not have an edge? do they get lost? count as insertion! --> compare counts for edge graphs when counting in cluster files or in graph files
- do more statistics: in how many clusters is each species represented, percentages of elements in certain clusters/cographs/noncographs..., 
  length of clusters, report cluster information when only looking at synteny!
- parameter to set cluster length limits
- give option for user to switch of several parts of the pipeline
- option to include newick tree
- solution for noncographs 



#General ideas and keywords:
- repeats: repeat masker
- ePope usage: counting of events and ePoPE (run epope for each group of elements, summrize counts for to one resulting tree)
