ToDo file for our pipeline project:

#All
- name!
- look for ensembl msa's (EPO) instead of multiz. They can be converted into each other, and ensembl msa seem to have better quality (see m. smith, australia) (LATER!)
- talk to Fabian for block clarification (LATER!)
- think about how to handle introns (see T. Lowe - search for paper from him or waiting for his email)
- add parameter as a maximal or minimal threshold for cluster sizes (genomic dis
tance between anchors) - see talk T. Lowe
- some elements are not sorted into anchors (sbRNAs, distant related species)

#Sarah & Anne
- search for a student to build up our GUI
- compare our results from Y RNAs with https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1074747/  and   https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17470436

#Anne (Do until 09.12.16)
- get newick trees of the remaining species (sources, tool for user)
- check sbRNAs cm and run again (single cm or cambination)
- create 4 other Y RNA models for testing
- repeats: repeat masker (think about e.g. alu repeats)
- create test runs 

#Anne
- newick tree to ePoPE format parser
- ePoPE format to newick
- postscript script to draw trees
- postscript script to draw graphs -> we need a drawing algorithm, so it might be better to use python/latex/perl instead of ps

#Cameron
- include reading of zipped data (do not unzipped files as we get memory issues)
- delete bed files, temporary files (everything we don't need anymore)
- optimize reading of multiz alns (ask fabian externbrink)
- more detailed explanation for gene list input (README_cameron)
- gene lists: be able to include unique IDs for elements such that they can be found later in the graphs

#Sarah
- include counting of singletons/NoneCluster/edgeGraphs/noedgeGraphs in pipeline
- still mistakes in summary (no NoneCluster folder anymore?)
- do not print camerons output (too much)
- for genetic events: always sort the species list alphabetically, such that the entries can be summarized easily! write the summary, ePoPE
- check all 'list' files such that only the real names of the clusters are printed, not all the paths.
- accept a phylogenetic tree in newick format as input to add the genetic events directly to the tree (one tree for each event?)
- only cographs used for count of genetic events? what about noncographs? if not included in genetic events, count them differently!!!
- what happens to elements in edge graphs that themselves do not have an edge? do they get lost? count as insertion! --> compare counts for edge graphs when counting in cluster files or in graph files
- solution for noncographs 
- write drawGraphs.pl
##more parameters?
- give input parameters for alignment (possible for altNW?)
- give option for user to switch off several parts of the pipeline
- do more statistics: in how many clusters is each species represented, percentages of elements in certain clusters/cographs/noncographs..., 
  length of clusters, report cluster information when only looking at synteny!
- parameter to set cluster length limits
- option to include newick tree


#General ideas and keywords:
- ePope usage: counting of events and ePoPE (run epope for each group of elements, summarize counts for to one resulting tree)
- think about distinguishing insertion events as: duplication, 'jumping' (where did it come from?) or completely new element
